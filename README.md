# Container-agnostic service providers

**Work in progress.**

This project is part of the [container-interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) group. It tries to find a solution for cross-framework modules (aka bundles) by the means of container-agnostic configuration.

## Background

Three main alternatives were identified to solve this problem:

- standard PHP objects/interfaces representing container definitions
- standard container configuration format (e.g. XML, â€¦)
- standard service providers

The first solution that container-interop members tried to implement was [a set of standard PHP interfaces for container definitions](https://github.com/container-interop/definition-interop). While this solution is working, it has a few limitations and it is complicated to explain, understand and use.

There were then discussions about a standard configuration format (for example in XML), which has the advantage of being slightly easier to understand and use for module developers. This work has not be formalized yet because of the amount of work needed. This approach would also suffers from a few of the limitations identified in the first approach. It would also requires the inclusion in the standard of many specific features: the standard must define many different ways for how objects can be created and dependencies injected. That makes the standard complex to define, and would force all containers (even simple ones) to support all the features.

This repository contains a proposition for **standard service providers** (service providers are PHP components that provide container entries). This approach has turned out to be simpler on many level:

- the standard is much simpler, which means it is easier to explain and understand
- it is easier to use as it relies on plain old PHP code
- it is easier to implement support in containers

## Goal of this project

This project is currently at its experimental phase: the goal is to try this standard in frameworks, containers and modules and iterate until it can be considered as a viable solution for **container-agnostic configuration**.

Until a 1.0.0 release the code in this repository is not stable. Expect changes breaking backward compatibility between minor versions (0.1.x -> 0.2.x).

## Usage

To declare a service provider, simply implement the `ServiceProvider` interface.

```php
use Interop\Container\ServiceProvider\ServiceProvider;

class MyServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'my_service' => 'createMyService',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function createMyService(ContainerInterface $container, $previous = null)
    {
        $dependency = $container->get('my_other_service');
    
        return new MyService($dependency);
    }
}
```

The `getServices()` static method must return a list of all container entries the service provider wishes to register:

- the key is the entry name
- the value is the name of the static method that will return the entry, aka the **factory method**

Factory methods must be public and static in the service provider class. They accept the following parameters:

- the container (instance of `Interop\Container\ContainerInterface`)
- the previous entry if overriding a previous entry, or `null` if not

There is no difference between defining an entry from scratch or overriding/extending an entry. Factory methods always get the `$previous` value for the entry, it is up to you to *use it or ignore it* if it's not `null`.

If know you will be ignoring the `$previous` value, you can omit it from the parameters.

### Values (aka parameters)

A service provider can provide PHP objects (services) as well as any value. Simply return the value you wish from factory methods.

### Aliases

To alias a container entry to another, you can get the aliased entry from the container and return it:

```php
class MyServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'my_service' => 'createMyService',
            'alias' => 'resolveAlias',
        ];
    }
    
    // ...
    
    public static function resolveAlias(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
        return $container->get('my_service');
    }
}
```

### Entry overriding

Overriding an entry defined in another service provider is as easy as defining it again.

Module A:

```php
class A implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'foo' => 'getFoo',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getFoo()
    {
        return 'abc';
    }
}
```

Module B:

```php
class B implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'foo' => 'getFoo',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getFoo()
    {
        return 'def';
    }
}
```

If you register the service providers in the correct order in your container (A first, then B), then the entry `foo` will be `'def'` because B's definition will override A's.

### Entry extension

Extending an entry before it is returned by the container is very similar to overriding it.

Module A:

```php
class A implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'logger' => 'getLogger',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getLogger()
    {
        return new Logger;
    }
}
```

Module B:

```php
class B implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'logger' => 'getLogger',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getLogger(ContainerInterface $container, $previous = null)
    {
        // Register a new log handler
        $previous->addHandler(new SyslogHandler());
    
        // Return the object that we modified
        return $previous;
    }
}
```

If you register the service providers in the correct order in your container (A first, then B), the logger will be first created by `A` then a new handler will be registered on it by `B`.
